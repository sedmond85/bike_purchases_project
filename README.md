# ðŸš² Analyzing Bike Purchases & Commute Distance

In this project, I explored a dataset that looks at bike purchase behavior in relation to commuting distance. The data includes whether a customer purchased a bike and how far they typically commute â€” offering insights into how transportation habits might influence buying decisions.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Included

- `bike_purchases_dataset_project.xlsx` â€“ The dataset I used, which includes purchase decisions, commute distances, and other relevant details.

## ðŸ“Š What I Did

- Cleaned and organized the Excel data
- Compared commute distances between those who did and didnâ€™t buy a bike
- Prepared the dataset for deeper analysis in Excel, Python, or SQL
